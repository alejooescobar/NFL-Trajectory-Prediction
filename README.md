# CPSC502

This project is a Computer Science research project from my last year at the University of Calgary. This project takes data from the NFL Big Data Bowl competition and uses it to create player trajectory arrays (2D tensors) for analysis and to train a LSTM machine learning model. The papers in this repository document methodology and assumptions used in this project.

The main topics of this project include but are not limited to:

- Machine Learning: LSTM, Clustering, etc...
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sports Data Visualization

Local deployment for this project is currently not available. Please reach out to the author for any questions at alejoesc2000@gmail.com.
